Java Project Name:  IC03_ChangeMaker

Write a Java console application that determines the change to be dispensed from the register at a grocery store (think of the change machines at Vons or Albertsons).  Your program should output how many quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies should be given for an amount between 1 to 99 cents.  Use the Scanner class to read in a number of cents from the user (between 1 and 99) and then output how many quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies should be given.
